MA Angle Trading System:

The Signal Score is the core output of this trading system - it's a numerical representation (ranging from -100 to +100) that quantifies the overall bullish or bearish strength based on moving average relationships. Here's its significance:
What the Signal Score Represents:
1. Composite Market Sentiment

+100: Perfect bullish alignment (all MAs ascending, properly ordered, expanding upward)
-100: Perfect bearish alignment (all MAs descending, properly ordered, expanding downward)
0: Neutral/conflicted signals

2. Three-Component Analysis
The score combines:

Alignment (40% weight): How MAs are ordered relative to each other
Angle Momentum (30% weight): Direction and steepness of each MA
Spread Momentum (30% weight): Whether MAs are expanding or contracting

Trading Significance:
Signal Zones:

+60 to +100: Strong BUY zone
+20 to +59: Weak bullish (caution)
-19 to +19: NEUTRAL (no clear direction)
-20 to -59: Weak bearish (caution)
-60 to -100: Strong SELL zone

Why This Matters:
**1. Removes Subjectivity:
Instead of visually interpreting "are the MAs bullish?", you get a precise number
**2. Early Warning System:

Score rising from 30 to 50 = building bullish momentum
Score falling from 70 to 40 = weakening trend (potential exit)

**3. Risk Management:

Higher absolute scores = higher conviction trades
Lower scores = reduce position size or wait

**4. Backtesting & Optimization:

Can test different threshold levels (50 vs 60 vs 70)
Quantify which score ranges produce best results

Practical Examples:
Score = +85: All MAs trending up strongly, properly aligned, expanding - High confidence BUY
Score = +35: Mixed signals, some MAs flat, weak alignment - Wait for better setup
Score = -72: Strong bearish setup, all MAs declining with good alignment - High confidence SELL
Score fluctuating around 0: Choppy/sideways market - Avoid trading
Advanced Usage:

Divergences: Price making new highs while score declining = potential reversal
Momentum: Rate of score change can indicate acceleration/deceleration
Multiple Timeframes: Compare scores across timeframes for confluence

The signal score essentially converts complex MA relationships into a single, actionable number that removes emotion and guesswork from your trading decisions.

The Alignment Score is a crucial component (40% weight) of the overall signal that measures how the moving averages are positioned relative to each other. It ranges from -100 to +100 and tells you if the MAs are in the "correct" order for trending markets.
What Alignment Score Measures:
Perfect Bullish Alignment (+100):
Price > Fast MA (20) > Medium MA (50) > Slow MA (200)

All MAs stacked in ascending order
Classic bullish trend structure
Each MA acting as dynamic support

Perfect Bearish Alignment (-100):
Price < Fast MA (20) < Medium MA (50) < Slow MA (200)

All MAs stacked in descending order
Classic bearish trend structure
Each MA acting as dynamic resistance

Mixed/Choppy Alignment (0 to ±50):
Examples:
- Fast MA > Slow MA > Medium MA (tangled)
- Medium MA > Fast MA > Slow MA (partial order)
How It's Calculated:
The script checks three key relationships and assigns partial scores:

Fast MA vs Medium MA: ±33.33 points
Medium MA vs Slow MA: ±33.33 points
Fast MA vs Slow MA: ±33.33 points

Example Calculations:
Scenario 1: Perfect Bull Market

Fast(150) > Medium(145) > Slow(140) = +100
All relationships bullish = +33.33 + 33.33 + 33.33 = +100

Scenario 2: Mixed Signals

Fast(150) > Medium(145) but Medium(145) < Slow(148)
+33.33 (fast>medium) -33.33 (medium<slow) +33.33 (fast>slow) = +33.33

Trading Significance:
Why Alignment Matters:
**1. Trend Identification:

High positive alignment = strong uptrend
High negative alignment = strong downtrend
Low alignment = sideways/choppy market

**2. Support/Resistance Levels:

In bullish alignment: each MA below acts as support
In bearish alignment: each MA above acts as resistance

**3. Trend Strength:

Perfect alignment (+100/-100) = mature, established trend
Improving alignment (30→60→90) = developing trend
Deteriorating alignment (90→60→30) = weakening trend

Practical Examples:
Alignment = +100:

All MAs perfectly stacked bullish
Strong uptrend in progress
Look for dips to MA levels as buying opportunities

Alignment = +33:

2 out of 3 MA relationships bullish
Trend forming or weakening
Wait for confirmation

Alignment = 0:

MAs tangled/crossing
Sideways market
Avoid trend-following strategies

Alignment = -100:

Perfect bearish stack
Strong downtrend
Look for rallies to MA levels as selling opportunities

Common Patterns:
Trend Development:
-100 → -50 → 0 → +50 → +100
(Bear → Weakening → Neutral → Building → Bull)
Trend Reversal Warning:
+100 → +66 → +33 → 0
(Strong Bull → Weakening → Failing)
The alignment score essentially tells you whether the market structure supports your intended trade direction - it's like having a "trend quality meter" that removes guesswork about whether MAs are properly aligned for trending conditions.
